# Project Description
This IoT project is to measure temperature and relative humidity using DHT11 sensor and NodeMCU ESP32

Data read by the sensor is temperature and humidity data. Data on ESP32 is converted into JSON file format and then sent to the MQTT broker (in this project I use Eclipse Mosquitto) via WiFi.

# Hardware Requirements
1. NodeMCU : ESP32
2. Sensor  : DHT11
3. Jumper Wires
4. Project Board (Optional)
